<h5>
BALLYCLORAN HOUSE AS FIRST SEEN BY THE AUTHOR.
</h5>

<div class="chpt_end">
<p>
  <span>I</span>n the autumn, 184--, business took me into the West of Ireland,
  and, amongst other places, to the quiet little village of Drumsna,
  which is in the province of Connaught, County Leitrim, about 72 miles
  W.N.W. of Dublin, on the mail-coach road to Sligo. I reached the
  little inn there in the morning by the said mail, my purpose being to
  leave it late in the evening by the day coach; and as my business was
  but of short duration, I was left, after an early dinner, to amuse
  myself. Now, in such a situation, to take a walk is all the brightest
  man can do, and the dullest always does the same. There is a kind of
  gratification in seeing what one has never seen before, be it ever
  so little worth seeing; and the gratification is the greater if the
  chances be that one will never see it again. Now Drumsna stands on a
  bend in the Shannon; the street leads down to a bridge, passing over
  which one finds oneself in the County Roscommon; and the road runs
  by the well-wooded demesne of Sir G---- K----; moreover there is a
  beautiful little hill, from which the demesne, river, bridge, and
  village can all be seen; and what farther _agremens_ than these could
  be wanted to make a pretty walk? But, alas! I knew not of their
  existence then. One cannot ask the maid at an inn to show one where
  to find the beauties of nature. So, trusting to myself, I went
  directly away from river, woods, and all,--along as dusty, ugly, and
  disagreeable a road as is to be found in any county in Ireland.
</p>

<p>
  After proceeding a mile or so, taking two or three turns to look for
  improvement, I began to perceive evident signs on the part of the
  road of retrograding into lane-ism; the county had evidently deserted
  it, and though made for cars and coaches, its traffic appeared to be
  now confined to donkeys carrying turf home from the bog, in double
  kishes on their back. Presently the fragments of a bridge presented
  themselves, but they too were utterly fallen away from their
  palmy days, and in their present state afforded but indifferent
  stepping-stones over a bog stream which ran, or rather crept, across
  the road. These, however, I luckily traversed, and was rewarded
  by finding a broken down entrance to a kind of wood on the right
  hand. In Ireland, particularly in the poorer parts--to rank among
  which, County Leitrim has a right which will not be disputed--a
  few trees together are always the recognised sign of a demesne,
  of a gentleman's seat, or the place where a gentleman's seat has
  been; and I directly knew that this must be a demesne. But ah! how
  impoverished, if one might judge from outward appearances. Two brick
  pillars, from which the outside plaster had peeled off and the coping
  fallen, gave evidence of former gates; the space was closed up with
  a loose built wall, but on the outer side of each post was a little
  well worn footpath, made of soft bog mould. I of course could not
  resist such temptation, and entered the demesne. The road was nearly
  covered with that short dry grass which stones seem to throw up, when
  no longer polished by the wealthier portion of man or brute kind.
</p>

<p>
  About thirty feet from the gap a tall fir had half fallen, and lay
  across the road, so that a man should stoop to walk under it; it was
  a perfect barrier to any equipage, however humble, and the roots had
  nearly refixed themselves in their reversed position, showing that
  the tree had evidently been in that fallen state for years.
</p>

<p>
  The usual story, thought I, of Connaught gentlemen; an extravagant
  landlord, reckless tenants, debt, embarrassment, despair, and ruin.
  Well, I walked up the deserted avenue, and very shortly found myself
  in front of the house. Oh, what a picture of misery, of useless
  expenditure, unfinished pretence, and premature decay!
</p>

<p>
  The house was two stories high, with large stone steps up to the
  front door, with four windows in the lower, and six in the upper
  story, and an area with kitchens, &c., below. The entire roof was
  off; one could see the rotting joists and beams, some fallen, some
  falling, the rest ready to fall, like the skeleton of a felon left
  to rot on an open gibbet. The stone steps had nearly dropped through
  into the area, the rails of which had been wrenched up. The knocker
  was still on the door,--a large modern lion-headed knocker; but half
  the door was gone; on creeping to the door-sill, I found about six
  feet of the floor of the hall gone also--stolen for fire wood. But
  the joists of the flooring were there, and the whitewash of the walls
  showed that but a few, a very few years back, the house had been
  inhabited. I leaped across the gulf, at great risk of falling into
  the cellar, and reached the bottom of the stairs; here my courage
  failed me; all that was left was so damp and so rotten, so much had
  been gradually taken away, that I did not dare to go up: the doors on
  the ground floor would not open; the ceiling above me was all gone,
  and I could see the threatening timbers of the roof, which seemed
  only hanging till they had an opportunity of injuring some one by
  their fall. I crept out of the demi-door again, and down the ruined
  steps, and walked round the mansion; not only was there not a pane of
  glass in the whole, but the window frames were all gone; everything
  that wanted keeping was gone; everything that required care to
  preserve it had perished. Time had not touched it. Time had evidently
  not yet had leisure to do his work. He is sure, but slow. Ruin works
  fast enough unaided, where once he puts his foot. Time would have
  pulled down the chimneys--Ruin had taken off the slates; Time would
  have bulged the walls--Ruin brought in the rain, rotted the timbers,
  and assisted the thieves. Poor old Time will have but little left him
  at Ballycloran! The gardens had been large; half were now covered by
  rubbish heaps, and the other half consisted of potato patches; and
  round the out-houses I saw clustering a lot of those wretched cabins
  which the poor Irish build against a deserted wall, when they can
  find one, as jackdaws do their nests in a superannuated chimney.
  In the front there had been, I presume, a tolerably spacious lawn,
  with a drive through it, surrounded on all sides, except towards the
  house, by thick trees. The trees remained, but the lawn, the drive,
  and the flower patches, which of course once existed there, were now
  all alike, equally prolific in large brown dock weeds and sorrels.
  There were two or three narrow footpaths through and across the
  space, up to the cabins behind the house, but other marks of humanity
  were there none.
</p>

<p>
  A large ash, apparently cut down years ago, with the branches still
  on it, was stretched somewhat out of the wood: on this I sat, lighted
  a cigar, and meditated on this characteristic specimen of Irish life.
  The sun was setting beautifully behind the trees, and its imperfect
  light through the foliage gave the unnatural ruin a still stronger
  appearance of death and decay, and brought into my mind thoughts of
  the wrong, oppression, misery, and despair, to which some one had
  been subjected by what I saw before me.
</p>

<p>
  I had not been long seated, when four or five ragged boys and girls
  came through the wood, driving a lot of geese along one of the
  paths. When they saw me, they all came up and stood round me, as if
  wondering what I could be. I could learn nothing from them--the very
  poor Irish children will never speak to you; but a middle aged man
  soon followed them. He told me the place was called Ballycloran: "he
  did not know who it belonged to; a gintleman in Dublin recaved the
  rints, and a very stiff gintleman he was too; and hard it was upon
  them to pay two pound tin an acre for the garden there, and that
  half covered with the ould house and the bricks and rubbish, only
  on behalf of the bog that was convaynient, and plinty of the timber,
  tho' that was rotten, and illigant outhouses for the pigs and the
  geese, and the ould bricks of the wall wor good manure for the
  praties" (this, in all my farming, I had never dreamt of); "but
  times was very hard on the poor, the praties being ninepence a stone
  in Carrick all last summer; God help the poor, the crayturs! for
  the gintlemin, their raal frinds, that should be, couldn't help
  thimselves now, let alone others"--and so on, now speaking of his
  sorrow and poverty, and again descanting on the "illigance" of
  his abode. I could only learn that a family called the Macdermots
  had lived there some six or seven years back, that they were an
  unfortunate people, he had heard tell, but he had not been in the
  country then, and it was a bloody story, &c. &c. &c. The evening was
  drawing on, and the time for my coach to come was fast approaching;
  so I was obliged to leave Ballycloran, unsatisfied as to its history,
  and to return to Drumsna.
</p>

<p>
  Here I had no time to make further inquiries, as Mr. Hartley's
  servants always keep their time; and very shortly the four horses
  clattered down the hill into the village. I got up behind, for
  McC----, the guard, was an old friend of mine; and after the usual
  salutations and strapping of portmanteaus, and shifting down into
  places, as McC---- knows everything, I began to ask him if he knew
  anything of a place called Ballycloran.
</p>

<p>
  "'Deed then, Sir, and I do," said he, "and good reason have I to
  know; and well I knew those that lived in it, ruined, and black, and
  desolate, as Ballycloran is now:" and between Drumsna and Boyle, he
  gave me the heads of the following story. And, reader, if I thought
  it would ever be your good fortune to hear the history of Ballycloran
  from the guard of the Boyle coach, I would recommend you to get it
  from him, and shut my book forthwith.

  CHAPTER II.

<h5>
  THE MACDERMOT FAMILY.
</h5>

<div class="chpt_end">
<p>
  <span>M</span>cC----'s story runs thus. About sixty years ago, a something
  Macdermot, true Milesian, pious Catholic, and descendant of king
  somebody, died somewhere, having managed to keep a comfortable little
  portion of his ancestors' royalties to console him for the loss of
  their sceptre. He having two sons, and disdaining to make anything
  but estated gentlemen of them, made over in some fictitious manner
  (for in those righteous days a Roman Catholic could make no legal
  will) to his eldest, the estate on which he lived, and to the
  youngest, that of Ballycloran--about six hundred as bad acres as a
  gentleman might wish to call his own. But Thaddeus, otherwise Thady
  Macdermot, being an estated gentleman, must have a gentleman's
  residence on his estate, and the house of Ballycloran was accordingly
  built. Had Thady Macdermot had ready money, it might have been well
  built; but though an estated gentleman, he had none. He had debts
  even when his father died; and though he planned, ordered, and agreed
  for a house, such as he thought the descendant of a Connaught Prince
  might inhabit without disgrace, it was ill built, half finished,
  and paid for by long bills. This, however, is so customary in poor
  Ireland that it but little harassed Thady. He had a fine, showy
  house, with stables, &c., gardens, an avenue, and a walk round his
  demesne; and his neighbours had no more. It was little he cared
  for comfort, but he would not be the first of the Macdermots that
  would not be respectable. When his house was finished, Thady went
  into County Galway, and got himself a wife with two thousand pounds
  fortune, for which he had to go to law with his brother-in-law. The
  lawsuit, the continual necessity of renewing the bills with which
  the builder in Carrick on Shannon every quarter attacked him, the
  fruitless endeavour to make his tenants pay thirty shillings an acre
  for half-reclaimed bog, and a somewhat strongly developed aptitude
  for potheen, sent poor Thady to another world rather prematurely,
  and his son and heir, Lawrence, came to the throne at the tender age
  of twelve. The Galway brother-in-law compromised the lawsuit; the
  builder took a mortgage on the property from the boy's guardian;
  the mother gave new leases to the tenants; Larry went to school at
  Longford; and Mrs. Mac kept up the glory of Ballycloran.
</p>

<p>
  At the age of twenty, Lawrence, or Larry, married a Milesian damsel,
  portionless, but of true descent. The builder from Carrick had made
  overtures about a daughter he had at home, and offered poor Larry
  his own house, as her fortune. But the blood of the Macdermots
  could not mix with the lime and water that flowed in a builder's
  veins; he therefore made an enemy where he most wanted a friend, and
  brought his wife home to live with his mother. In order that we may
  quickly rid ourselves of encumbrances, it may be as well to say that
  during the next twenty-five years his mother and wife died; he had
  christened his only son Thaddeus, after his grandfather, and his only
  daughter had been christened Euphemia, after her grandmother. He
  had never got over that deadly builder, with his horrid percentage
  coming out of the precarious rents; twice, indeed, had writs been out
  against him for his arrears, and once he had received notice from Mr.
  Hyacinth Keegan, the oily attorney of Carrick, that Mr. Flannelly
  meant to foreclose. Rents were greatly in arrear, his credit was
  very bad among the dealers in Mohill, with Carrick he had no other
  dealings than those to which necessity compelled him with Mr.
  Flannelly the builder, and Larry Macdermot was anything but an easy
  man.
</p>

<p>
  Thady was at this time about twenty-four. As had been the case with
  his father, he had been educated at a country school; he could
  read and write, but could do little more: he was brought up to no
  profession or business; he acted as his father's agent over the
  property--by which I mean to signify that he occupied himself in
  harrowing the tenantry for money which they had no means of paying;
  he was occasionally head driver and ejector; and he considered, as
  Irish landlords are apt to do, that he had an absolute right over
  the tenants, as feudal vassals. Still, they respected and to a
  certain extent loved him; "for why? wasn't he the masther's son, and
  wouldn't he be the masther hisself?" And he had a regard, perhaps
  an affection, for the poor creatures; against any one else he
  would defend them; and would they but coin their bones into pounds,
  shillings, and pence, he would have been as tender to them as a man
  so nurtured could be. With all his faults, Thady was perhaps a better
  man than his father; he was not so indomitably idle; had he been
  brought up to anything, he would have done it; he was more energetic,
  and felt the degradation of his position; he felt that his family was
  sinking lower and lower daily; but as he knew not what to do, he only
  became more gloomy and more tyrannical. Beyond this, he had acquired
  a strong taste for tobacco, which he incessantly smoked out of a
  dhudheen; and was content to pass his dull life without excitement or
  pleasure.
</p>

<p>
  Euphemia, or Feemy, was about twenty; she was a tall, dark girl,
  with that bold, upright, well-poised figure, which is so peculiarly
  Irish. She walked as if all the blood of the old Irish Princes was
  in her veins: her step, at any rate, was princely. Feemy, also, had
  large, bright brown eyes, and long, soft, shining dark hair, which
  was divided behind, and fell over her shoulders, or was tied with
  ribands; and she had a well-formed nose, as all coming of old
  families have; and a bright olive complexion, only the olive was a
  little too brown, the skin a little too coarse; and then Feemy's
  mouth was, oh! half an inch too long; but her teeth were white and
  good, and her chin was well turned and short, with a dimple on it
  large enough for any finger Venus might put there. In all, Feemy
  was a fine girl in the eyes of a man not too much accustomed to
  refinement. Her hands were too large and too red, but if Feemy got
  gloves sufficient to go to mass with, it was all she could do in
  that way; and though Feemy had as fine a leg as ever bore a pretty
  girl, she was never well shod,--her shoes were seldom clean, often
  slipshod, usually in holes; and her stockings--but no! I will not
  further violate the mysteries of Feemy's wardrobe. But if the
  beautiful girls of this poor country knew but half the charms which
  neatness has, they would not so often appear as poor Feemy too
  usually appeared.
</p>

<p>
  Like her brother, she was ardent and energetic, if she had aught
  to be ardent about; she was addicted to novels, when she could get
  them from the dirty little circulating library at Mohill; she was
  passionately fond of dancing, which was her chief accomplishment;
  she played on an old spinnet which had belonged to her mother; and
  controlled the motions and actions of the two barefooted damsels who
  officiated as domestics at Ballycloran.
</p>

<p>
  Such was the family at Ballycloran in the summer of 183--, and
  though not perfect, I hope they have charms enough to make a further
  acquaintance not unacceptable.
